This aligns with our objective of providing detailed career recommendation based on user data like skills, courses, and job history. Compared to other models like LaMA, GPT offers higher-quality outputs without the need for extensive fine-tuning or local deployment, making it both powerful and practical for integration. Its ease of use through the OpenAI API, combined with its state-of-the-art performance in natural language generation, made GPT the most suitable choice for enhancing our system with intelligent and personalized career support."

    "Providing a summary of possibale career paths, based onâ€‚the userâ€™s skills. It briefly discusses some common roles like a Food Microbiologist, Product Development Scientist, and a Sales/Marketingâ€‚Coordinator. This isâ€‚informative, but it is rather just a descriptively listed content and does not provide in-depth insights on specific qualification and preparation required for each role.\n",

    "Goes one step further by not only suggesting job titles but even specific preparation steps, such as getting certified (e.g., ISO 9001, Six Sigma, HACCP) or graduate studies. It shows a better understanding of how the user can grow into each position, so the advice is more specific and actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tone and Professionalism\n",
    "#### -Template 1: \n",
    "Uses a helpful tone  but lacks the authoritative voice that would be expected from a professional advisor. It sounds more like a \"here are some suggestions\" list\n",
    "#### -Template 2:\n",
    "Adopts the voice of a career advisor, as intended. It recommends targeted actions, like getting certifications and degrees, which reflects a more expert and structured tone. This approach makes the AI sound more trustworthy and intentional in guiding the userâ€™s career.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Structure and Readability\n",
    "#### -Template 1:\n",
    "Is narrative-based, starting with an overview of the userâ€™s qualifications and then listing potential careers. This makes it easy to read, but not highly structured for planning.\n",
    "#### -Template 2: \n",
    "Is role-by-role structured, where each potential career path is clearly laid out with a job title and its associated preparation steps. This format is more useful for users who want to take concrete steps toward a specific role.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.Use Case Suitability\n",
    "#### -Template 1:\n",
    "Is better for quick inspiration or general guidance, especially for users just exploring career possibilities.\n",
    "#### -Template 2: \n",
    "Is more appropriate for users who are serious about career planning and need focused advice. It fits the purpose of a professional AI-enhanced advisor much better.\n",

This template allows the Generative AI model to simulate the behavior of a professional career advisor by considering multiple aspects of the user's background, including their skills, courses, and recent job titles. Unlike the Simple Instruction Prompt which offers general suggestions based on limited input, the Role-Based Prompt encourages the model to generate more personalized and structured recommendation. This aligns directly with our systemâ€™s goal of providing users with realistic and helpful career recommendation. By framing the prompt in a way that gives the model a defined role and rich context, the quality and relevance of the output are significantly enhanced, making it the preferred template for integration.\n"
